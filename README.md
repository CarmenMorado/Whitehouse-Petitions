# Whitehouse-Petitions
100 Days of Swift (Project 7) An app that loads the most recent petitions from the Whitehouse (We the People) API and allows users to filter them. Throughout the
course of this project, I learned about the Codeable protocol, UITabBarController, data parsing, injecting HTML into a web view, UIStoryboard, and more. 
In addition, I completed the following challenges:

-Add a Credits button to the top-right corner using UIBarButtonItem. When this is tapped, show an alert telling users the data comes from the We The People API of the Whitehouse.
-Let users filter the petitions they see. This involves creating a second array of filtered items that contains only petitions matching a string the user entered. Use a UIAlertController with a text field to let them enter that string. This is a tough one, so I’ve included some hints below if you get stuck.
-Experiment with the HTML – this isn’t a HTML or CSS tutorial, but you can find lots of resources online to give you enough knowledge to tinker with the layout a little.
