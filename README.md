# Whitehouse-Petitions
100 Days of Swift (Project 7) An app that loads the most recent petitions from the Whitehouse (We the People) API and allows users to filter them. Throughout the
course of this project, I learned about the Codeable protocol, UITabBarController, data parsing, injecting HTML into a web view, UIStoryboard, and more.
